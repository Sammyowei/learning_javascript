/*
Adding comments:
1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. 
Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line: 
let a = 10;
2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of 
10.
3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this 
will do.

let input = prompt("Hi How are you?");
let a = 10;
let inputData = input.toLocaleUpperCase;
console.log(a);
console.log(inputData.toString);
